# CGGR Daily Holdings Tracker

Automatically downloads the Capital Group Growth ETF (CGGR) daily holdings Excel file, diffs it against the prior day, and displays changes on a GitHub Pages dashboard.

## What it does

- **Every weekday at 9:30 AM ET**, a GitHub Actions job runs automatically
- It downloads the holdings Excel file, parses Ticker / % of Net Assets / Shares columns
- Saves a dated JSON snapshot to `data/`
- Computes a diff vs. the most recent prior snapshot
- Commits the results back to the repo
- Your GitHub Pages dashboard reflects the latest diff automatically

## Dashboard features

- Summary cards: total holdings, changed, added, removed
- Color coded rows: green = added, red = removed, yellow = changed
- Filter by status, search by ticker, sort multiple ways
- Mini bars showing visual magnitude of each change
